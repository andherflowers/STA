A repository of my Statistics courses taken at UofT

**STA302H5F - Regression Analysis (R)

Analysis of the multiple regression model by least squares; statistical properties of the least square analysis, including estimation of error; residual and regression sums of squares; distribution theory under normality of the observations; confidence regions and intervals; tests for normality; variance stabilizing transformations, multicolinearity, variable search methods.

**STA304H5F: Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data (LaTeX, R plots only)

The course covers: design of surveys, sources of bias, randomized response surveys. Techniques of sampling; stratification, clustering, unequal probability selection. Sampling inference, estimates of population mean and variances, ratio estimation, observational data; correlation vs. causation, missing data, sources of bias. 


**STA314H5F - Introduction to Statistical Learning (R)

A thorough introduction to the basic ideas in supervised statistical learning with a focus on regression and a brief introduction to classification. Methods covered will include multiple linear regression and its extensions, k-nn regression, variable selection and regularization via AIC,BIC, Ridge and lasso penalties, non-parametric methods including basis expansions, local regression and splines, generalized additive models, tree-based methods, bagging, boosting and random forests. Content will be discussed from a statistical angle, putting emphasis on uncertainty quantification and the impact of randomness in the data on the outcome of any learning procedure. A detailed discussion of the main statistical ideas behind crossvalidation, sample splitting and re-sampling methods will be given. Throughout the course, R will be used as software, a brief introduction will be given in the beginning.
