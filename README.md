A repository of my Statistics courses taken at UofT requiring computer packages

**STA258H5S - Statistics with Applied Probability (R)**

A survey of statistical methodology with emphasis on the relationship between data analysis and probability theory.

Topics: descriptive statistics, limit theorems, sampling distribution, point and interval estimation both classical and bootstrap, hypothesis testing both classical and bootstrap, permutation tests, contingency tables and count data. A statistical computer package will be used.

**STA302H5F - Regression Analysis (R)**

Analysis of the multiple regression model by least squares; statistical properties of the least square analysis, including estimation of error; residual and regression sums of squares; distribution theory under normality of the observations; confidence regions and intervals; tests for normality; variance stabilizing transformations, multicolinearity, variable search methods.

**STA304H5F - Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data (LaTeX, R plots only)**

Topics: design of surveys, sources of bias, randomized response surveys. Techniques of sampling; stratification, clustering, unequal probability selection. Sampling inference, estimates of population mean and variances, ratio estimation, observational data; correlation vs. causation, missing data, sources of bias. 

**STA312H5 - Survival Analysis | Topics in Statistics: Applied Statistical Modelling (R)**

Introduction to a topic of current interest in statistics. Content will vary from year to year. Computer packages are used.

Topics: Maximum likelihood, Censoring, Survival function, Distributions, Hazard and cumulative hazard function, Parametric analysis for a single sample, Life tables, Kapan-Meier estimates, Parametric regression for censored data, Proportional hazards model, Time-varying covariates. R will be used for computation.

**STA314H5F - Introduction to Statistical Learning (R)**

A thorough introduction to the basic ideas in supervised statistical learning with a focus on regression and a brief introduction to classification. Content will be discussed from a statistical angle, putting emphasis on uncertainty quantification and the impact of randomness in the data on the outcome of any learning procedure. A detailed discussion of the main statistical ideas behind crossvalidation, sample splitting and re-sampling methods will be given. Throughout the course, R will be used as software, a brief introduction will be given in the beginning.


Topics: multiple linear regression and its extensions, k-nn regression, variable selection and regularization via AIC,BIC, Ridge and lasso penalties, non-parametric methods including basis expansions, local regression and splines, generalized additive models, tree-based methods, bagging, boosting and random forests. 

**STA305H5S - Experimental Design (R)**

This course covers topics in the design and analysis of experiments. The topics covered include analysis of variance, randomization, confounding, block designs, factorial designs, orthogonal polynomials and response surface methods. Applications include agricultural experiments, laboratory experiments, and industrial experiments, including quality control techniques.

**STA441H5S - Methods of Applied Statistics (SAS)**

Vocabulary of data analysis, Tests of statistical significance, Principles of research design, Introduction to unix and SAS, Applications of statistical methods such as Multiple regression, Factorial ANOVA, Mixed linear models, Multivariate analysis of variance, Repeated measures, Logistic regression, Generalized linear models, Permutation tests and Bootstrapping.
