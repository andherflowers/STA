STA304H5F - Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data

The sample survey is a widely used technique for obtaining information about a large population at relatively small cost. Only probability samples can provide both an estimator and a measure of sampling error from the data itself. In addition to sampling error, non-sampling errors (refusals, not-at-home, lies, inaccuracies, etc.) are always present, and can produce serious biases.

The course covers: design of surveys, sources of bias, randomized response surveys. Techniques of sampling; stratification, clustering, unequal probability selection. Sampling inference, estimates of population mean and variances, ratio estimation, observational data; correlation vs. causation, missing data, sources of bias. [36L, 12T]

Additionally, this course required students to prepare a group project throughout the term consisting of:

- Selecting a target population with question(s) of interest
- Designing a questionnaire to answer our questions of interest
- Collecting data from a sample
- Analyzing the data and making inferences based on them
- Concluding our findings in technical and non-technical language
